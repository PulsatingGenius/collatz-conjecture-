## collatz-conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture that is first proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. It is also known as the  conjecture, the Ulam conjecture, the Kakutani’s problem, the Thwaites conjecture, or the Syracuse problem “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems”, Paul Erdos once speculated about the Collatz Conjecture .

The conjecture can be stated simply as follows: take any positive integer number . If is even, divide it by  to get . If  is odd, multiply it by  and add  to get . Repeat the process again and again. The Collatz Conjecture is that no matter what the number (i.e., ) is taken, the process will always eventually reach . The longest progressions for initial starting numbers of less than 10 billion and 100 quadrillion are calculated by Gary T. Leavens  and R. E. Crandall, respectively. Wei Ren et al. verified  can return to 1 after 481603 times of  computation, and 863323 times of  computation, which is the largest integer being verified in the world . So far no one has tried to figure out whether all of the positive numbers eventually reach one, but we know that most of them do so. In particular, Krasikov and Lagarias proved that the number of integers finally reaching one in the interval  is at least proportional to x 0.84.
